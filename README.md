# meta

The goal of this meetup is to show one workflow (tools and processes) useful to run data-science meetups. It's *meta* because it's a meetup about meetups, and was developed using the workflow it will demonstrate.

At the end of this meetup, you will know how to:

* Use this workflow to run data-science meetups.
* Adapt this workflow based on your own values and needs.

## Who is the audience?

Anyone interested in learning and sharing data-science knowledge within and organization and with the broader data-science community. It's particularly useful if you are responsible for leading data-science meetups. 

## Why is it important?

* As a meetup developer you'll save time, teach more effectively, and stand out as an expert in the field.
* As a meetup participant you'll get a more consistent, pleasant, and useful learning experience.
* As a data-science organization you'll improve onboarding, develop internal talent, and advertise your work.
