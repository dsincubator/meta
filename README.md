The goal of this data-science meetup is to show one workflow (tools and processes) useful to run data-science meetups. 

At the end of this meetup, you'll be able to do things like this:

* Use this workflow to run data-science meetups.
* Adapt this workflow based on your own values and needs.

## Who is the audience?

* People responsible for leading data-science meetups, e.g. me. 
* People who attend to data-science meetups, e.g. you.
* Organizations who hire people like you and me, e.g. ixpantia.

> The first step ... is figuring out who your audience is.

## Why is it important?

* As a meetup developer you'll save time, teach more effectively, and stand out as an expert in the field.
* As a meetup participant you'll get a more consistent, pleasant, and useful learning experience.
* As a data-science organization you'll improve onboarding, develop internal talent, and advertise your work.

## Objectives

* Learn the details of the workflow used in this meetup, and the values that drove it.
* Reflect on your own values and discuss how you would adapt this workflow to better suit your needs.
