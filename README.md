The goal of this data-science meetup is to show one workflow (tools and processes) useful to run data-science meetups. 

At the end of this meetup, you'll be able to do things like this:

* Use this workflow to run data-science meetups.
* Adapt this workflow based on your own values and needs.

## Who is the audience?

* People responsible for leading data-science meetups. 
* People who attend to data-science meetups.

> The first step ... is figuring out who your audience is.

## Why is it important?

* As a meetup developer you'll save time, teach more effectively, and stand out as an expert in the field.
* As a meetup participant you'll get a more consistent, pleasant, and useful learning experience.

## Objectives

* Learn the details of the workflow used in this meetup, and the values that drove it.
* Understand how values can help you find a meetup workflow that works for you.

## Demo

* [Explore examle materials of a series of meetups](https://github.com/2degreesInvesting/ds.testing).
* [Draft a new meetup](https://github.com/new).

## Structure

Minimal:

```
org/repo/README.md
```

Nice to have:

* Repo template https://github.com/dsincubator/template:
  * Meetup materials: README.md (series also need a meetup/README.md)
  * Meetup checklist: .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE ([Configuring issue templates](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/configuring-issue-templates-for-your-repository))
* Topics poll: https://github.com/dsincubator/template/discussions
* Collaborative document: https://bit.ly/dsincubator-doc
* Blog: https://dsincubator.github.io/

## Excercises

### Role play

You are responsible for running a project like the dsincubator. Every week you need to prepare and often deliver a data-science meetup.

Consider the values of the dsincubator project and reflect on your own values. 

With those values in mind, answer as many questions as you can.

* What's the name of your project? e.g. dsincubator
* Where do you host the Git repos? e.g. GitHub
* Are your repos private or public? e.g. Public
* Where do you host the recordings? e.g. YouTube
* Are the your recordings private or public? e.g. Public
* Where do you share the materials and videos? e.g. LinkedIn

## Additional questions

These additional questions may help you prepare for the many other decisions you will eventually need to make:

  * How would you present the materials? e.g. directly from markdown files.
  * How would you decide meetup topics? e.g. By consultation via a poll.
  * How long would each meetup be? e.g. 20' presentation + 10' discussion.
  * Would you rotate the responsability to develop and lead meetups? How? e.g. Yes, every 3 months.
  * Would you like to present meetups? e.g. Yes, occationally on topics I'm most pationate about.
  * Would you develop the text content in English or another languge? e.g. Mostly English but other occationally in Spanish.
  * Would you present the content during the meetup in English or another languge?  e.g. Mostly English but other occationally in Spanish.
